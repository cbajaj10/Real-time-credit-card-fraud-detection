# Real-time-Supervised-Fraud-detection-Model-on-Applications-Data

Looking at the application's history from several individuals by monitoring entities (SSN, Name, Address, ZipCode, dob, home phone) with fraud label to make a real-time fraud detection model

Steps Followed:

a) Data Quality Report to understand what exactly this data is, compute spread across different variables, and report any outlier or frivolous value that might skew the model results

b) Data cleaning and Manipulation

c) Feature Engineering (Expert variables were created using Days since, Velocity of applications according to specific entities)

d) Feature Selection using KS and FDR

e) Further, feature selection using Random Forest Wrapper

f) Modelling on selected features using RF and Fraud labels were predicted

g) Making business recommedations
